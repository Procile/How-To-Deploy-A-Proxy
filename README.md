# Get A Domain -
### If you haven't already, get a domain :
##### PorkBun : https://porkbun.com/
##### FreeNom : https://freenom.com/ (currently not working)

# Add It To Cloudflare -
(skip this step if you don't plan on adding a custom domain)
(for this demonstration i'm going to be using freenom)
##### So first add the nameservers that cloudfare gives you
